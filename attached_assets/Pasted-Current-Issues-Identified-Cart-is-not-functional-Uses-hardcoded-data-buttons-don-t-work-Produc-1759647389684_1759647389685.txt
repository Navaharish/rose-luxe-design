Current Issues Identified:
Cart is not functional - Uses hardcoded data, buttons don't work
Products use hardcoded mock data - No backend database
No detailed product descriptions - Limited product information
No payment integration - Razorpay needs to be implemented
Admin panel is not functional - Can't actually add/remove products
No data persistence - Everything is lost on refresh
README needs comprehensive documentation
Production-Ready E-commerce Platform Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Backend Setup with Lovable Cloud (Supabase)
1.1 Database Schema Design
Create the following tables in Supabase:

products table:

id (UUID, primary key)

price (decimal)
category (text)
image_url (text)
stock (integer)
rating (decimal)
ingredients (text)
how_to_use (text)
is_active (boolean)
created_at (timestamp)
updated_at (timestamp)
cart_items table:

id (UUID, primary key)
user_id (UUID, foreign key to auth.users)
product_id (UUID, foreign key to products)
quantity (integer)
created_at (timestamp)
orders table:

id (UUID, primary key)
user_id (UUID, foreign key to auth.users)
total_amount (decimal)
status (text) - pending, confirmed, shipped, delivered
payment_id (text) - Razorpay payment ID
payment_status (text)
shipping_address (jsonb)
created_at (timestamp)
order_items table:

id (UUID, primary key)
order_id (UUID, foreign key to orders)
product_id (UUID, foreign key to products)
quantity (integer)
price (decimal)
reviews table:

product_id (UUID, foreign key to products)
user_id (UUID, foreign key to auth.users)
rating (integer)
comment (text)
created_at (timestamp)
wishlists table:

user_id (UUID, foreign key to auth.users)
product_id (UUID, foreign key to products)
created_at (timestamp)
1.2 Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
Public read access for products
Authenticated users can manage their own cart, orders, reviews, and wishlist
Admin role for product management (using admin_users table or custom claims)
1.3 Storage Bucket Setup
Create product-images bucket for product photos
Public read access with authenticated upload

Key Technical Decisions:
Backend: Lovable Cloud (Supabase) for:

PostgreSQL database
Authentication
Storage for images
Edge Functions for payment verification
Real-time subscriptions for cart updates

Styling: Existing Tailwind + shadcn/ui components (already well-designed)

File Structure: Keep it organized as outlined in README
